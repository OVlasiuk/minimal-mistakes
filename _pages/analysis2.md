Measure and Integration II (MAA5617)
----

The main text is Folland, *Real analysis*. For useful examples, see Gelbaum and Olmsted, *Counterexamples in analysis*. For the connections with category theory, consult Oxtoby, *Measure and category*. Some standard sources on geometric measure theory include Mattila, *Geometry of sets and measures in Euclidean spaces* and Evans-Gariepy, *Measure theory and fine properties of functions*.

Another great book to check out is Kolmogorov and Fomin, *Elements of the theory of functions and functional analysis*, available as [copyleft](https://archive.org/details/IntroductoryRealAnalysis/)! A comprehensive reference on measure theory, also available as copyleft, is the [treatise](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm) of Fremlin.
