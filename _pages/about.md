## Summary
I'm a graduate student in Mathematics at Vanderbilt University, working with the
Minimal energy group: [Ed Saff](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/edsaff/) and [Doug
Hardin](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/doughardin/). The things I like include
[computational geometry]({{ "/_pages/code" | absolute_url}}), measure
concentration, and large deviations. If the formatting on this page looks
strange to you, it's because of the underlying CSS. If it does not,
congratulations, you're probably viewing it on a desktop!
