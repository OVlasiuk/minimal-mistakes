Hello! I am Alex Vlasiuk, a postdoc in Mathematics at Florida State University, working with [Alexander Reznikov](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~reznikov/).<br>
I've got my PhD from Vanderbilt University, where [Ed Saff](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/edsaff/) was my advisor, and [Doug Hardin](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/doughardin/) an (informal) coadvisor.<br>

<br>

The things I like include [computational geometry](/_pages/code), geometric measure theory, and measure concentration. Also, incidentally, [Stanis≈Çaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cyberiad) [Lem's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_XIV) [writings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Pirx_the_Pilot).
