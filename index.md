Hello! I am Alex Vlasiuk, a postdoc in Mathematics at Florida State University, working with [Alexander Reznikov](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~reznikov/).
I've got my PhD from Vanderbilt University, where [Ed Saff](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/edsaff/) was my advisor, and [Doug Hardin](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/doughardin/) an (informal) coadvisor.<br>

<br>

I am interested in convex and [computational](/_pages/code) geometry, geometric measure theory, and [behavior of minimizers](/_pages/publist) of variational functionals.
